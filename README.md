# Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/linuxmint/blueberry.git

#### Building the package

```
# Use mint-build to build the project for the first time.
# This also fetches and installs the build dependencies:
mint-build

# If mint-build fails with error like: mint-build: command not found
# Install [mint-dev-tools]([url](https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-dev-tools))

# In subsequent builds, you can use dpkg-buildpackage for faster builds:
dpkg-buildPackage
